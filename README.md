# CaseStudy_BikeShare
A case study that I made for my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

This data is based on [Divvy Bike Share](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) (2019-2020).It compares members and casual riders, focusing on differences in ride length. The findings show that casual riders tend to ride longer than members. From a business perspective, it is recommended for the company to encourage casual riders to convert into members.
